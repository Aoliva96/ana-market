## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced world, finding a convenient and reliable way to buy, sell and trade goods within your local community can be a challenge. Whether you're looking to declutter your home, find unique treasures, or connect with your neighbors, ANA Market is here to revolutionize the way you navigate the marketplace.

## Problem

Many Online Marketplaces suffer from cluttered and outdated interfaces and unorganized listings, making it challenging for users to find what they’re looking for efficiently. Some existing marketplaces may charge high transaction fees or commissions, cutting into the profits of sellers and increasing the overall cost.

## Solution

ANA Market addresses these challenges by offering a revolutionary platform designed to streamline the marketplace for users. 

Concept:
A Facebook marketplace / Craigslist inspired e-commerce app.

Features:
- User can create, read, delete, update their own listing
- Users that are not logged in can only see the listing preview w/ image, item name, price
- User must be logged in to see the seller’s name, contact info, item description, etc.
- Profile creation, profile page with list of user’s added listings
- Dashboard with a gallery of items for sale
